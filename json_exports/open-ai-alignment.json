Be sure to preserve important details and information of the text.\n\n        Our alignment research aims to make artificial general intelligence (AGI) aligned with human values and follow human intent. We take an iterative, empirical approach: by attempting to align highly capable AI systems, we can learn what works and what doesn\u2019t, thus refining our ability to make AI systems safer and more aligned. Using scientific experiments, we study how alignment techniques scale and where they will break.\n\nWe tackle alignment problems both in our most capable AI systems as well as alignment problems that we expect to encounter on our path to AGI. Our main goal is to push current alignment ideas as far as possible, and to understand and document precisely how they can succeed or why they will fail. We believe that even without fundamentally new alignment ideas, we can likely build sufficiently aligned AI systems to substantially advance alignment research itself.\n\nUnaligned AGI could pose substantial risks to humanity and solving the AGI alignment problem could be so difficult that it will require all of humanity to work together. Therefore we are committed to openly sharing our alignment research when it\u2019s safe to do so: We want to be transparent about how well our alignment techniques actually work in practice and we want every AGI developer to use the world\u2019s best alignment techniques.\n\nAt a high-level, our approach to alignment research focuses on engineering a scalable training signal for very smart AI systems that is aligned with human intent. It has three main pillars:\n\nTraining AI systems using human feedback\nTraining AI systems to assist human evaluation\nTraining AI systems to do alignment research\nAligning AI systems with human values also poses a range of other significant sociotechnical challenges, such as deciding to whom these systems should be aligned. Solving these problems is important to achieving our mission, but we do not discuss them in this post.\n        \n        \n        OVERVIEW STRUCTURE: I. Introduction A. Aim of Alignment Research B.
