The analysis pipeline is using ChatGPT for validation of claims, and extraction of claims from summary (as it was performing better at this than davinci-003). Add your ChatGPT access token (you can get it from here: [Link](https://chat.openai.com/api/auth/session)), as ```chatgpt_access_token = 'YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN'```. Alternatively, you can also add your email/password for ChatGPT by setting ```chatgpt_email = 'your-email'```, and ```chatgpt_pass = 'your-password'```
